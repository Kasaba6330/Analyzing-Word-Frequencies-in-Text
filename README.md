# Analyzing-Word-Frequencies-in-Text
This project will guide you through the process of analyzing word frequencies in a text corpus. The goal is to apply the statistical techniques covered so far-such as calculating means, variance, and distributions-to gain insights into the linguistic characteristics of the dataset.
###Project Overview
###Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the frequency distribution of words in a given text corpus. This will include:
1. Calculating basic statistics(mean,variance) of word frequencies.
2. Visualizing the frequency distribution of common words.
3. Comparing observed word frequencies with expected distribution (e,g., normal or poisson distributions).
4. Drawing insightsabout word usage patterns in the dataset.

###Dataset
For this project, we will use a sample dataset such as the text of "Àsà àti ìse Yorùbá C. L. Adéoyé". You can easily replace this with any other text dataset, such as tweets, product reviews, or news articles.
